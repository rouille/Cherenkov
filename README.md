# Cherenkov Signal produced by cosmic rays induced air showers
This is a full Monte-Carlo simulation to characterize the Cherenkov signal produced by extensive air showers (EAS) at ground. This includes the modeling of the EAS and the number of Cherenkov photons produced per interval of slant depth and angle with respect to the EAS axis.
